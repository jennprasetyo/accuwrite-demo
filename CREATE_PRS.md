```
A/B testing setup complete for new CTA button variations. The glassmorphism effect looks great! 

I've implemented the framework to test:
- Version A: Standard CTA positioning (left-aligned)  
- Version B: Center-aligned CTA with enhanced copy

Early results show Version B performing 15% better on mobile. Should we roll this out?
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Issue Found**: Hero image loading too slow on mobile devices

I'm seeing load times of 4.2 seconds on 3G connections. The hero image is causing a significant bottleneck:
- Original size: 2.1MB
- Current compressed: 850KB (needs further optimization)

**Recommendations**:
1. Use WebP format for modern browsers
2. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
3. Add progressive JPEG fallback

Can we target <2 second load time for the hero section?
```

**Add this reply as Mike:**
```
@sarah-kim Good catch! I've implemented additional compression and lazy loading. Latest tests show:
- Hero image now loads in 1.8s on 3G
- 60% size reduction achieved
- WebP format with JPEG fallback added

Performance is now within target range. Ready for review!
```

### 4. Create PR #3 - Contact Form Updates
- Base: `main` ‚Üê Compare: `feature/contact-form-updates`
- Title: `Enhance contact form with A/B testing setup`

- Added two-column layout for better form completion
- Enhanced form styling with card design and subtle shadows
- Implemented A/B testing for form variations and social proof
- Added textarea for use case capture to improve lead quality
- Included form field interaction tracking for optimization

A/B testing setup complete for new CTA button variations. Form conversion should improve with the new above-the-fold positioning and enhanced UX.

## Test Plan

üöÄ **A/B Testing Framework Complete!**

I've set up comprehensive testing for the contact form:

**Version A** (Control):
- Standard form layout
- "Start Free Trial" CTA
- Basic social proof

**Version B** (Test):
- Above-the-fold positioning  
- "Get Started Free - Join the Beta" CTA
- Enhanced social proof: "Join 1,000+ teams who've eliminated progress report pain"

**Early Results** (48 hours):
- Version A: 3.2% conversion rate
- Version B: 4.8% conversion rate (+50% improvement!)

Form field analytics also show better completion rates with the two-column layout. Recommend rolling out Version B!
