**Branch**: feature/mobile-responsiveness-fixes → main
**Author**: Sarah Kim
**Status**: Open

### Description

### Comments:
**@sarah-kim** commented 4 hours ago:
> ⚠️ **Performance Issue Found**: Hero image loading too slow on mobile devices
>
> I'm seeing load times of 4.2 seconds on 3G connections. The hero image is causing a significant bottleneck:
> - Original size: 2.1MB
> - Current compressed: 850KB (needs further optimization)
> 
> **Recommendations**:
> 1. Use WebP format for modern browsers
> 2. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
> 3. Add progressive JPEG fallback
> 
> Can we target <2 second load time for the hero section?

**@mike-chen** replied 2 hours ago:
> @sarah-kim Good catch! I've implemented additional compression and lazy loading. Latest tests show:
> - Hero image now loads in 1.8s on 3G
> - 60% size reduction achieved
> - WebP format with JPEG fallback added
> 
> Performance is now within target range. Ready for review!
